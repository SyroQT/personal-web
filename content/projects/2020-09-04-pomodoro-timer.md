excerpt: My take on the popular pomodoro style timer. Build with JS and React.
---
# Reasons for the project
After completing React course I knew that I want to build something my own. I landed on this timer concept because it is relatively simple app for the first timer to build. It does not have much state to manage and it will be used by my and few of my friends for study sessions. 
# Stack
- React coded with VS code

# What I learnt 
I did not had any mayor roadblocks. I knew what I needed to do and how to code it. The hardest part was formatting the time like I wanted and keeping track of work, break, and current times in a way that it would be easy to use. Another harder thing was using 3rd party modules (for the circle timer and playing sounds) as it was my first time doing it however after reading the documentation I was able to implement it easily.
