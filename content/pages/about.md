  ## Some of my bigger passions

  ### Coding and Programming

  Well it should be obvious from my choice of study that I love them. 

  Writing code allows me to express my imagination. As I am quite a logical thinker this is the best way to spend my time meaningfully. 

  ### Writing 

  Similar to the last point. I love to writing more creatively when I am not feeling or am tired from pure logical mindset. This is a perfect way to switch up my hobbies and get some rest. 

  ### Coffee 

  This is my choice of drug and I am happy that it is legal. Coffee is so much more then a drink in the morning for me. 

  It is a whole culture. There are so many ways to prepare a cup of coffee... So many variants of the beans... Do not forget the experience of sitting for hours and hours with friends next to a coffee cup...
