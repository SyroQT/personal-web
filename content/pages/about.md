  ## My coding literacy

  ### Languages

  - I started with C++ as it was required in school and it was my first language. 

  - Then during CS50 course I learned some C and some Python.

  - I continued learning Python on my own while coding projects.

  - When web development cough my attention I learned JavaSript on my free time.


  ## Some of my bigger passions

  ### Coding and Programming

  Well it should be obvious from my choice of study that I love it. 

  The ability to write and understand code for me is math manifestation in the physical world. This is the idea which drives me to learn and understand more each day.

  ### Writing 

  I love to express my feelings and ideas more creatively whenever I get the chance. This passion of mine lets me to get some rest from pure logical nature of programming. 

  ### Coffee 

  This is my choice of drug and I am happy that it is legal. Coffee is so much more then a drink in the morning for me. It is a sacred morning ritual. It is a way to relax, to find new connections.
