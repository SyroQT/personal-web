  ## My coding literacy


  ### Languages


  * I started with C++ as it was required in my school. 

  * Then during [Harvards CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science) course I learned basics of C and Python.

  * I continued learning Python on my own while coding some projects.

  * When web development cough my attention I learned JavaSript on my free time.


  ## Some of my bigger passions


  ### Coding and Programming


  Well it should be obvious from my choice of study that I love it. 

  The ability to write and understand code for me is something magical. This is the idea which drives me to learn and understand more each day.


  ### Writing


  I love to express my feelings and ideas more creatively whenever I get the chance. This passion of mine lets me to get some rest from pure logical nature of programming. 


  ### Coffee


  This is my drug of choice and I am happy that it is legal. Coffee is so much more than a morning drink for me. It is a sacred morning ritual. It is a way to relax, to find new connections.
